		<h1>Duct Tape Dummy (DTD) Guide</h1>

		<p>A duct tape dummy is required for any commissions involving a body as it is my preferred way to make the suit to fit you! This page has links to tutorials as well as the specific requirements for those who are commissioning me.</p>
		<h2>Requirements:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>You and/or your character's name is written somewhere on the torso of your DTD for easy identification.</li>
			<li>Using plastic wrap or paper towels, extend the DTD to cover part of your hands, including a thumb loop to help me position the handpaws so that the sleeves will be long enough to overlap them, and include the heel of your foot so that I have an accurate representation of where the feetpaws will sit.</li>
			<li>You've made sure that every part of the DTD has at least two layers of higher quality duct tape to prevent it from peeling apart under stress.</li>
			<li>You've taped over the parts that were cut when taking it off.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Construction:</h2>
		<p>There's already good guides out there much better than anything I can type and Mischief Makers has a very good tutorial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RonWr75R28Q">found here!</a> An alternative to using a painter's suit as a base uses trash bags, as seen on <a href="http://www.mordrudesmonsters.com/dtd.html">this tutorial by Mordrude's Monsters.</a> Both have great tips if you're completely new to making a duct tape dummy and want to ensure it'll translate to the best fit for your fursuit.</p>
